The review was led by \\nan vastly experienced group of current and past players, coaches, referees \\nand administrators of the sport from community competitions to the elite \\ninternational game. This group consulted broadly within the Australian \\ncommunity to develop a set of playing rules that could be applied across all \\nlevels of the sport. \\nThe result was the TFA 8th Edition Playing Rules. \\nAt the Federation of International Touch Paris Convention held in October \\n2019 Touch Football Australia presented the TFA 8th Edition Playing Rules and \\nsubsequently offered FIT and all National Touch Associations (NTAs) royalty \\nfree rights to use the newly developed rules. \\nConsequently, the FIT Board resolved to adopt the TFA 8th Edition Playing Rules \\nas the 5th Edition FIT Playing Rules to be used across all levels of the game \\ninternationally. FIT and its Members acknowledge and thank Touch Football \\nAustralia for the rights to use these rules.\\nWhilst consistency in the application of the rules of the game is important, FIT \\nencourages its members to offer features in local competition rules to ensure \\nthat all participants enjoy a high quality experience. These Rules in no way \\nrestrict any NTA or their authorised competition providers from having different \\nmatch conditions to these Rules. Any adaptation of or alterations to the Rules \\nfor local competitions should be clearly articulated in relevant competition \\nguidelines and be readily available for players, coaches and referees alike\\nPreamble\\nCOPYRIGHT © Touch Football Australia 2020\\nAll rights reserved.
